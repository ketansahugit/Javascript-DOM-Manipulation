# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript DOM Manipulation Projects repository. Here, you'll find a collection of five projects that I developed while following a comprehensive
JavaScript DOM manipulation course. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in dynamically modifying the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript,
enabling me to create interactive and engaging web applications.

## Project Overview

Each project in this repository showcases different aspects of DOM manipulation and interaction:

- **Quote Generator:** Generate inspiring quotes with a click of a button.
- **Modal:** Create a responsive modal popup for enhanced user experience.
- **Accordion:** Build an expandable accordion to organize content.
- **Stopwatch:** Implement a stopwatch to track time accurately.
- **To-Do List:** Develop a task management system to keep track of your tasks.
